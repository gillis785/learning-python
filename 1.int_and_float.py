# Fundamental Data Types
# int and 
# float is a number with a decimal point 0.5
# type will show if the answer is a int or a float

print(type(2 + 4)) # = 6 is a integer
print(type(2 - 4)) # = 2 is a integer
print(type(2 * 4)) # = 8 is a integer
print(type(2 / 5)) # 0.5 is a float

print(type(10.56)) # would be a float

print(9.9 + 1.1) # 11.0 is a float

print(2 ** 2) # 2 to the power of 2

print(2 // 4) # = 0 because // turns 0.5 to integer

print(5 % 4) # modulo operation, remainder
# this division equals 1.25 % converts to the 
# nearest integer so it is 1

print(6 % 4) # division would be 1.5 % converts 
# to the nearest integer so it is 2
